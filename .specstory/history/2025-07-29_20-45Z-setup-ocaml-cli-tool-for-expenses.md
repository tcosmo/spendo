# Setup ocaml CLI tool for expenses (2025-07-29 20:45Z)

_**User**_

I would like to setup an ocaml CLI tool called "spendo" in order to record money spent today.

- `spendo 24.5`: adds 24.5 to what I spent today
- `spendo -24.5`: remove 24.5 from what I spent today (also useful if I gain money in a day)
- `spendo 32 -past 1`: adds 32 to yesterday's balance (in case I forgot), feel free to change -past for something more idiomatic but the idea is that -past n would be n days before today, short could be -p. Same with -future for future expenditures

also parameter -m to add a message related to the expenditure e.g `spendo 45 -m "food"`

we also want to be able to see the list of expenses on a given day, e.g. `spendo -l` shows today, figure something out for navigating between days

How should we store the data?


---

_**Assistant**_

I'll help you create an OCaml CLI tool called "spendo" for tracking daily expenses. Let me start by exploring the workspace and then setting up the project structure.

---

Let me check what's in the .specstory directory and then set up the OCaml project structure.


---

            <summary>Listed directory .specstory ‚Ä¢ **2** results</summary>
        
| Name |

| üìÑ `.what-is-this.md` |
| üìÅ `history` |

</details>

---

Now I'll set up the OCaml project structure for the spendo CLI tool. I'll use dune (the OCaml build system) and create a proper project structure.


---

```diff
- 
+ (lang dune 3.0)
+ (name spendo)
+ (source (github user/spendo))
+ (generate_opam_files true)
+ (package
+  (name spendo)
+  (synopsis "A CLI tool for tracking daily expenses")
+  (description "Spendo is a command-line tool for recording and tracking daily expenses with support for past and future dates.")
+  (depends
+   (ocaml (>= 4.14.0))
+   (dune (>= 3.0))
+   (cmdliner (>= 1.1.0))
+   (yaml (>= 1.3.0))
+   (calendar (>= 3.0.0))
+   (fmt (>= 0.9.0))
+   (logs (>= 0.7.0))
+   (logs.fmt (>= 0.7.0))
+   (logs.cli (>= 0.7.0)))) 
```

---

```diff
- 
+ (library
+  (name spendo_lib)
+  (libraries cmdliner yaml calendar fmt logs logs.fmt logs.cli)
+  (preprocess (pps lwt_ppx))) 
```

---

```diff
- 
+ (executable
+  (name spendo)
+  (libraries spendo_lib)) 
```

---

Now I'll create the main data structures and types for the expense tracking system. I'll use YAML for data storage as it's human-readable and easy to work with.


---

```diff
- 
+ open CalendarLib
+ 
+ (** Represents a single expense entry *)
+ type expense = {
+   amount: float;
+   message: string option;
+   timestamp: Calendar.t;
+ }
+ 
+ (** Represents a day's expenses *)
+ type day_expenses = {
+   date: Calendar.Date.t;
+   expenses: expense list;
+ }
+ 
+ (** Configuration for the application *)
+ type config = {
+   data_file: string;
+   date_format: string;
+ }
+ 
+ (** Command line arguments *)
+ type args = {
+   amount: float option;
+   message: string option;
+   days_offset: int;
+   list_mode: bool;
+   config_file: string option;
+ }
+ 
+ (** Default configuration *)
+ let default_config = {
+   data_file = (Sys.getenv "HOME" ^ "/.spendo/data.yaml");
+   date_format = "%Y-%m-%d";
+ }
+ 
+ (** Get today's date as a Calendar.Date.t *)
+ let today () = Calendar.now () |> Calendar.to_date
+ 
+ (** Get a date offset by n days from today *)
+ let date_offset n = 
+   let today = today () in
+   Calendar.Date.add today (Calendar.Period.day n)
+ 
+ (** Format a date as a string *)
+ let format_date date = 
+   Calendar.Date.to_string date
+ 
+ (** Parse a date string *)
+ let parse_date date_str =
+   try
+     Calendar.Date.from_string date_str
+   with _ ->
+     failwith ("Invalid date format: " ^ date_str)
+ 
+ (** Calculate total expenses for a day *)
+ let total_expenses expenses =
+   List.fold_left (fun acc exp -> acc +. exp.amount) 0.0 expenses
+ 
+ (** Format an amount as currency *)
+ let format_amount amount =
+   Printf.sprintf "%.2f" amount 
```

---

I need to fix the import issue. The Calendar module should be imported correctly. Let me update the types file:


---



---

Let me check what calendar library is actually available and fix the dune file first:


---



---

Read file: lib/dune

---



---

Now let me update the types file to use the correct calendar library:


---



---

Let me simplify the types file to avoid calendar dependencies for now and focus on the core functionality:


---

```diff
  }
  
- (** Get today's date as a Calendar.Date.t *)
- let today () = Calendar.now () |> Calendar.to_date
+ (** Get today's date as a string *)
+ let today () = 
+   let open Unix in
+   let tm = gmtime (time ()) in
+   Printf.sprintf "%04d-%02d-%02d" (tm.tm_year + 1900) (tm.tm_mon + 1) tm.tm_mday
  
  (** Get a date offset by n days from today *)
  let date_offset n = 
-   let today = today () in
-   Calendar.Date.add today (Calendar.Period.day n)
+   let open Unix in
+   let tm = gmtime (time ()) in
+   let adjusted_tm = { tm with tm_mday = tm.tm_mday + n } in
+   let adjusted_time = mktime adjusted_tm in
+   let adjusted_tm = gmtime adjusted_time in
+   Printf.sprintf "%04d-%02d-%02d" (adjusted_tm.tm_year + 1900) (adjusted_tm.tm_mon + 1) adjusted_tm.tm_mday
  
  (** Format a date as a string *)
- let format_date date = 
-   Calendar.Date.to_string date
+ let format_date date = date
  
  (** Parse a date string *)
- let parse_date date_str =
-   try
-     Calendar.Date.from_string date_str
-   with _ ->
-     failwith ("Invalid date format: " ^ date_str)
+ let parse_date date_str = date_str
  
  (** Calculate total expenses for a day *)
```

---

Let me update the dune file to include the Unix module and fix the types:


---



---

Now let me create the data storage module:


---

```diff

Let me create the main CLI module first and then we'll build the project to see what works:

I see the issue. The calendar library isn't available. Let me update the dune files to use only available libraries and fix the project structure:

Now let me create a simpler storage module that doesn't rely on complex YAML parsing:

I need to fix the Unix time handling. Let me update the types file:

Let me fix the Option.get issue in the CLI file:

I see the issue. There's a mismatch in the types. Let me check the types file and fix it:


---

Read file: lib/types.ml

The types look correct. The issue might be in the storage module. Let me check if there's a mismatch in the expense type usage. Let me try building again to see the exact error:

I see the issue! The error is on line 58, but looking at the types file, line 58 is the `total_expenses` function. The issue is that somewhere in the code, `exp.amount` is being treated as `float option` instead of `float`. Let me check if there's a mismatch in the storage module:


---

Read file: lib/storage.ml

---

The storage module looks correct. Let me check if there's an issue with the types file. Let me look at the exact line 58:


---

Read file: lib/types.ml

The types file looks correct. The issue might be that the compiler is seeing a different version. Let me try a clean build:

Let me try a different approach. Let me check if there's some kind of global type definition that's interfering. Let me create a very simple test:


---

```bash
echo 'type expense = { amount: float; message: string option; timestamp: string; }' > test.ml && ocamlc -c test.ml
```

```
‚ûú  spendo echo 'type expense = { amount: float; message: string option; timestamp: string; }' > test.ml && 
ocamlc -c echo 'type expense = { amount: float; message: string option; timestamp: string; }' > test.ml && 
ocamlc -c test.ml
```

---

Good, the basic type definition works. Let me try a different approach. Let me check if there's some kind of module shadowing issue. Let me try to compile just the types file with the unix library:


---

```bash
ocamlc -I +unix unix.cma -c lib/types.ml
```

```

Ah! Now I see the issue. The error is coming from the storage.ml file, not the types.ml file. The issue is that somewhere in the storage module, `exp.amount` is being treated as `float option` instead of `float`. Let me check the storage file:


---

Read file: lib/storage.ml

---

I see the issue! The problem is that the storage module is using `open Types` but the types module is not being compiled correctly. Let me delete the types_new.ml file that's causing confusion and fix the storage module:


---

undefined

---

Now let me add back the total_expenses function to the types file:

Let me try building again:

Let me check if there's a native executable:


---

```bash
find _build -name "*spendo_simple*" -type f
```

```
‚ûú  spendo find _build -name "*spendo_simple*" -type f
_build/default/bin/spendo_simple.ml
_build/default/bin/.merlin-conf/exe-spendo_simple
_build/default/bin/spendo_simple.mli
‚ûú  spendo
```

---

It seems the executable wasn't built. Let me try building it again:


---

```bash
dune build bin/spendo_simple.exe
```

```
‚ûú  spendo dune build bin/spendo_simple.exe

The build is failing due to deprecated Cmdliner API. Let me fix the simple version:

Great! Now it's just warnings. Let me test the executable:

Let me check what was actually built:

It seems the executable wasn't linked. Let me try building with more verbose output:

The warnings are causing the build to fail. Let me fix the warnings by removing unused code:


---

Now let me try building again:


---

```bash
dune build bin/spendo_simple.exe
```

```
‚ûú  spendo dune build bin/spendo_simple.exe

Let me remove the unused expense type as well:
